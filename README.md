## GA4D - Google Analytic for Delphi

### The GA4D library was created so that applications developed in Delphi can be analyzed more precisely, giving the possibility of better decision making on the behavior of users in the application.

* Link online and offline behaviors;
* Evaluate client-side and server-side interactions;
* Send events that happen outside of standard user interaction (e.g. offline conversions);
* Send events from devices and applications that do not have automatic collection available (e.g. kiosks, clocks, etc.).
